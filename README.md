I am a Software Developer. My interests are Full stack Web development,  Rust Programming language, and DevOps on Linux. Currently, I am learning about networking, database, and blockchain.

In a nutshell, I can make beautiful websites and utility software for your business, also I can manage your server and software deployment on a Linux machine.

I am a fan of automation and you know what it means. Mathematics does tempt me but believe me I can't sit with math textbooks for hours.
